Spring Boot :

Spring Provides IoC ( Inversion of Control ) :
IoC is a container in which there are all objects (of classes )

ApplicationContext is a way of implementation of IoC.
IoC is concept, ApplicationContext is implementation.

IoC or ApplicationContext, both can be used to describe each other

How it Works :

ApplicationContext Scans all the class under base package.
the base is the package inside which the main class file is there.

ApplicationContext finds out that on which classes there an Annotation "@Component" is used.

Annotation can be used on top of Class, Interface, Methods and even on Fields.
Annotations provides the information of relative class,interface,method or field.

On whichever class under the base package there is this "@Component" Annotation is
used , ApplicationContext keeps the objects of those classes.

those classes who have this "@Component" Annotation : those classes are then registered as spring bean.

IoC gives objects of the classes as and when needed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Entry point :

The Main Class, which includes main method in spring boot project, has this Annotation before its name
@SpringBootApplication

This Annotation must be used once and that too on main class.
This Annotation, itself does include three Annotation's working.
those 3 Annotations are ,
1. @ComponentScan :

this Annotation scans the base package of project and gives info regarding which class has @Component,
so that IoC has to have the objects of those class

2. @EnableAutoConfiguration :

this Annotation helps in Automate all the configurations.
for example, if our projects needs to connect to DB, then instead of writing its configurations,
we simply add necessary details like URL, UserName, Password etc., using this Annotation all the
configuration is done by spring boot.

3. @Configuration :

When we write this annotation on any class, then we are telling spring boot that
this class is providing some kind of configuration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dependency Injection :

@Autowired : whenever we want to have an instance(object) of any class in some other class,
we simply not create the object using new keyword,
instead we ask for the object of that class from IoC.
this is where we have to use @Autowired Annotation.
if class A has field having Type of class B. that means,  Class A is dependent on Class B.
herein, IoC Injects object of Class B in Class A.
This is called Dependency Injection.
