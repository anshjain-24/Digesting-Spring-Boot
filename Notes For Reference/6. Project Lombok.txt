Project Lombok :

Project Lombok is a java library that automatically plugs into your editor and build tools, spicing up your java.
Never write another getter or equals method again, with one annotation your class has a fully featured builder, Automate your logging variables, and much more

Lombok is a popular library in the Java ecosystem, often used
in Spring Boot applications.


It aims to reduce the boilerplate code that developers have to write,
such as getters, setters, constructors, and more.

Lombok achieves this by generating this code automatically during compilation,
based on annotations you add to your Java classes.


For example we have a class which is having some fields. 
we need to write getters and setters methods for those fields.

then using Lombok what we can do is, simply add @Getter and @Setter just above the class name.
It will add the getter and setter methods for each fields of that class on runtime.

there are many other annotations like NoArgsConstructor, AllArgsConstructor etc.




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
there is one Annotation called "Data"

@Data is Equivalent to @Getter @Setter @RequiredArgsConstructor @ToString @EqualsAndHashCode.


Remember to add @NoArgsConstructor Annotation above the classname, it is not compulsory but it is required in deserialization process,

Deserialize process is converting Json data to POJO (Plain Old Java Object). (in short to map the json data to save in java object)

For Deserialization No Arg Constructor is required which is not there in @Data.
