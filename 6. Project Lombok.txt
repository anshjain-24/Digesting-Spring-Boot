Project Lombok :

Project Lombok is a java library that automatically plugs into your editor and build tools, spicing up your java.
Never write another getter or equals method again, with one annotation your class has a fully featured builder, Automate your logging variables, and much more

Lombok is a popular library in the Java ecosystem, often used
in Spring Boot applications.


It aims to reduce the boilerplate code that developers have to write,
such as getters, setters, constructors, and more.

Lombok achieves this by generating this code automatically during compilation,
based on annotations you add to your Java classes.
